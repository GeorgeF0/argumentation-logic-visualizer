<h1>Argumentation Logic Visualizer Help Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Argumentation Logic Visualizer tool! Below you can find help on how to use this program and its features</p>

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase"></span> Clipboard</h2>
<p>The Clipboard holds proofs and other items that need to be retained. It acts as storage but also acts as a pool of available items to use on the Workbench.</p>
<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
<p>Each item is rendered in its own thumbnail, and can be dragged to its appropriate placeholder on the Workbench or on the Clear Clipboard button described below. A thumbnail looks like this:</p>
<div style="width:400px;height:500px;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:15px">
	<div class="thumbnail" style="height:100%">
		<p>This is a thumbnail!</p>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Drag/Drop Functionality</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, thumbnails can be dragged around and dropped on particular placeholders on the Workbench, or on the Clear Clipboard button. This button looks like this:</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger navbar-btn"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></span> Clear Clipboard</button>
<p>Dropping an item from the Clipboard onto this button will delete the item from the Clipboard. Clicking this button will delete all the contents of the Clipboard, but after a warning pop-up appears. There is no warning pop-up for dragging a single item onto this button and that item is deleted immediately.</p>
<p>A thumbnail can also be dragged and dropped onto the Export Clipboard button. This will open a new window with the exported proof inside. For more information on this refer to the last section of this help page. Clicking on the Export Clipboard button will export the entire Clipboard. The Export Clipboard button looks like this:</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-warning navbar-btn"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-open"></span> Export Clipboard</button>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>This application uses the HTML 5 web storage feature in order to save the contents of the Clipboard in case the web page is refreshed or closed. However, this storage may be deleted if the browser clears its data, so it should not be heavily relied upon. There is an export clipboard feature that can export the items stored in the Clipboard.</p>
<p>The web storage keeps the Clipboard in sync with itself. Whenever an item is added or deleted, or when the Clipboard is cleared using the Clear Clipboard button, the web storage is updated accordingly. The data is automatically loaded back into the clipboard when the page is refreshed.</p>

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> Workbench</h2>
<p>The Workbench is where the magic happens. The different tasks that can be performed have been split into tabs that all fall under the Workbench. Some of these tasks require the user to input pre-made proofs or arguments from the Clipboard, or to input logic sentences or natural deduction steps. The syntax used for logic sentences and natural deduction is explained in the next section</p>
<h3>Generate Proof Tab</h3>
<p>This tab is used to generate proofs given the theory and the goal automatically by the theorem prover provided. Simply enter a comma-separated list of formulas in the theory input box, and a single formula in the goal input box, and click on the Generate Proofs button as shown below:</p>
<nav class="navbar navbar-default" role="navigation" style="padding-left:15px">
	<div class="row">
	    <div class="col-lg-6">
	        <div class="form-group has-feedback" id="generateprooftheoryfeedback">
	            <div class="input-group" style="margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">
	                <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span></span>
	                <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Theory">
	            </div>
	        </div>
	    </div>
	    <div class="col-lg-2">
	        <div class="form-group has-feedback" id="generateproofgoalfeedback">
	            <div class="input-group" style="margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">
	                <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-screenshot"></span></span>
	                <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Goal">
	            </div>
	        </div>
	    </div>
	    <div class="col-lg-2">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-default navbar-btn"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span> Generate Proofs</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
<p>The different proofs that arrive to the given goal from the provided theory will be listed below, on the same tab. Drag any required proofs onto the Clipboard to store them. An example of a proof is given below:</p>
<div draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)" style="width:400px;height:500px;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:15px">
	<div class="thumbnail" style="height:100%;white-space:nowrap;overflow:auto">0  a  given<br> 1  !a  hypothesis<br> 2  falsity  _I(0,1)<br> 3  falsity  check(2)<br>4  !!a  !I(1,3)<br>5  a  !E(4)<br>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Build Proof Tab</h3>
<p>Sometimes there can be an overwhelming amount of generated proofs for a particular proof in mind. If such a specific proof is required, it can be typed in directly instead of generating it and finding it in the list of all generated proofs. Enter the theory and the goal into their respective input fields and then click on the build button to start the proof builder. The input fields and button look like so:</p>
<nav class="navbar navbar-default" role="navigation" style="padding-left:15px">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="form-group has-feedback" id="buildprooftheoryfeedback">
                <div class="input-group" style="margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">
                    <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span></span>
                    <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Theory">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-2">
            <div class="form-group has-feedback" id="buildproofgoalfeedback">
                <div class="input-group" style="margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">
                    <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-screenshot"></span></span>
                    <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Goal">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-2">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-default navbar-btn"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> Build Proof</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
<p>The theory will then appear as the first steps of the proof and the command input field is enabled and ready to take commands. The commands will be explained shortly. Steps can be referenced by their line numbers. The proof builder automatically numbers each step. Assuming the givens where !(a&amp;b) and !(b&amp;c), the proof under construction would look like this:</p>
<div class="well" id="proofunderconstruction">0  !(a&amp;b)  given<br>1  !(b&amp;c)  given<br></div>
The command input, now enabled, should look like this:
<div class="form-group has-feedback" id="buildproofcommandinputfeedback">
    <div class="input-group" style="width:100%">
        <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span></span>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter Command to Build Proof">
    </div>
</div>
<p>When the proof is finished (by reaching the previously specified goal) then the command input is disabled and the box above becomes draggable. Drag the proof onto the Clipboard to save. In order to start a new proof overwrite the theory and goal input fields and click on the Build Proof button again. This will reset the proof and re-enable the command input field.</p>
<h4>Commands</h4>
<p>In order to enter a command, simply type in the command in the command input field and press the Enter key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>The following commands are supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Step</li>
	<li>Delete last step</li>
	<li>Delete last n steps</li>
</ul>
<p>A step command is of the form "[formula]; [reason]". These contructs are described in the penultimate section. This command is used to add another step to the proof</p>
<p>The delete last step command is simply "--". This will delete the last step of the proof. If the last step of the proof was an application of the not introduction rule, then the context opens the box that the not introduction application had previously closed.</p>
<p>The delete last n steps command works much like the previous command, but the format is "-[number]".</p>
<p>The proof builder uses a parser and a rule verification system in order to check that the proof is according to the rules defined in natural deduction. If an incorrect command is entered, then the command input field will turn red as shown below:</p>
<div class="form-group has-feedback has-error" id="buildproofcommandinputfeedback">
    <div class="input-group" style="width:100%">
        <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span></span>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter Command to Build Proof">
    </div>
</div>
<p>Simply amend the command and try again.</p>
<h3>Check GAP Tab</h3>
<p>This tab is used to validate proofs as following the Genuine Absurdity Property. Drag a proof from the Clipboard that has not already been verified onto the thumbnail placeholder under that tab. The placeholder will then be filled in with the proof. Click on the Check GAP button in order to check whether the supplied proof follows the property. If it does, the proof will be given a certification ribbon as shown below:</p>
<div style="width:400px;height:500px;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:15px;position:relative">
	<div class="thumbnail" style="height:100%;white-space:nowrap;overflow:auto">0  a  given<br> 1  !a  hypothesis<br> 2  falsity  _I(0,1)<br> 3  falsity  check(2)<br>4  !!a  !I(1,3)<br>5  a  !E(4)<br><img src="img/gap-certificate.png" style="position:absolute;right:0;bottom:15px" draggable="false">
	</div>
</div>
<p>The proof can now be dragged back to the Clipboard</p>
<h3>Visualize GAP Proof Tab</h3>
<p>This tab allows for GAP-certified proofs to be visualized. This tab holds two placeholders. Drag a GAP proof from the Clipboard onto the left placeholder and click on the Visualize GAP Proof button. The proof will then be visualized and placed onto the right placeholder so that they can be viewed side-by-side. Drag the visualization onto the Clipboard in order to save it. An example of a visualized proof is given below:</p>
<div style="width:400px;height:500px;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:15px">
	<div class="thumbnail" style="height:100%">
		Argument Visualization Example!
		<div id="argex"></div>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Extract GAP Proof Tab</h3>
<p> This tab is used to transform an argument back to a proof. Drag a visualization onto the box on the left from the Clipboard, and click on the Extract GAP Proof button. A proof will then be extracted from the argument and placed onto the right placeholder so that they can be viewed side-by-side. Drag the extracted proof onto the clipboard in order to save it.</p>

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> Logic Syntax</h2>
<p>This section introduces the syntax used for propositional logic, and how a natural deduction proof is represented.</p>
<h3>Symbols for Propositional Logic</h3>
<p>The symbols for propositional logic used by this application are:</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Symbol</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>!</td>
			<td>Negation</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&amp;</td>
			<td>Conjunction</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>|</td>
			<td>Disjunction</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>-&gt;</td>
			<td>Implication</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>_</td>
			<td>Falsity (Contradiction)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>()</td>
			<td>Precedence (Grouping)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>The same symbols are used by the parser as well.</p>
<h3>Entering Propositional Formulas</h3>
<p>Single propositional formulas can be entered by typing in the formula using the symbols shown above. This is usually required when entering a goal to be proven. A list of propositional formulas is a comma-separated list of formulas. Space characters are ignored. Lists of formulas are usually required when specifying the theory (which might consist of more than just one formula).</p>
<h3>Natural Deduction Format</h3>
<p>Each line (step) in a natural deduction proof is made of the line number of that particular step, the deduction made during that step, and lastly, the reason for that conclusion. The reason may be a hypothesis (which makes subsequent steps enter a new context until a matching not introduction rule closes the box), a given (used to indicate the theory) or an application of a rule. A rule is made of a propositional logic symbol (for example "&amp;"), the letter "E" or "I" (meaning "Elimination" or "Introduction") and a pair of parentheses in which line numbers referencing previous steps are given to justify the rule (for example "(1,4)" - read "from lines 1 and 4"). Sub-contexts (boxes) are indicated by indentation. A hypothesis always opens a box (starts a new context) and an application of the not introduction rule or the arrow (implication) introduction rule close the box.</p>
<p>A short summary of all justifications (reasons) found in a natural deduction proof is given below. The symbol "#" just indicates any number referencing a previous step in the proof.</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Justification</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>!I(#,#)</td>
			<td>Not Introduction</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>!E(#)</td>
			<td>Not Elimination</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&amp;I(#,#)</td>
			<td>And Introduction</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&amp;E(#)</td>
			<td>And Elimination</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>|I(#)</td>
			<td>Or Introduction</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>|E(#,#,#,#)</td>
			<td>Or Elimination</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>-&gt;I(#,#)</td>
			<td>Arrow Introduction</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>-&gt;E(#,#)</td>
			<td>Arrow Elimination</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>_I(#,#)</td>
			<td>Falsity Introduction</td>

		<tr>
			<td>_E(#)</td>
			<td>Falsity Elimination</td>

		<tr>
			<td>given</td>
			<td>Indicates theory</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

		<tr>
			<td>check(#)</td>
			<td>Reiteration</td>

<p>The importing-exporting facility is described below:</p>
<h3>Exporting Clipboard</h3>
<p>The data stored in the Clipboard can be exported as strings of JSON text and can be saved/distributed/etc. Clicking on the Export Clipboard drop-down menu (or button on the Clipboard) will export the entire contents of the Clipboard. The data will be opened in a new window. If only one of the items on the Clipboard needs to be exported, simply drag that item onto the Clipboard's Export Clipboard button. Note that exporting items on the Clipboard does not delete them from it.</p>
<h3>Importing to Clipboard</h3>
<p>The text exported by the Export Clipboard drop-down menu or button can be imported back into the Clipboard by clicking on the Import to Clipboard drop-down menu. A pop-up appears with an input field that allows you to paste the JSON text in. Clicking on the Import to Clipboard button will validate the pasted text and if the validation succeeds, the parsed data will be added back to the Clipboard. If the validation fails however, the input field will turn red. Fix the errors and try again.</p>
